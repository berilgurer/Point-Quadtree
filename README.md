# Point Quadtree
Implementation of a point quadtree of cities. More specifically, given a 2D space and a list of cities, each of which is represented as a 2D point, cities will be inserted in the order they are given into an initially empty point quadtree. Then, given a query point A in the same space together with radius r, all the cities within the radius r of A will be found.
